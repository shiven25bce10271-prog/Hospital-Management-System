# Problem Statement:

Manual patient record-keeping is error-prone and time-consuming, making it difficult to quickly search for or update specific patient histories. This project solves the inefficiency of physical files by providing a digital, automated system to perform real-time CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on patient data.

# Scope of Project:

The project creates a digitized system for hospital administrators to efficiently store, search, and manage patient records in a centralized database.

# Target users:

The target users are hospital receptionists and administrative staff who need a streamlined digital interface to register new patients and maintain accurate medical records. It is also ideal for small clinic managers seeking a simple, low-cost solution to digitize and organize patient data without complex infrastructure.

# High-level Features

The project features a menu-driven command-line interface that facilitates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient patient record management. It utilizes a robust MySQL database backend to ensure persistent storage, enabling reliable data retrieval and seamless updates for administrative use.
